/**
 * PHP Server-Side Example for Fine Uploader (traditional endpoint handler).
 * Maintained by Widen Enterprises.
 *
 * This example:
 *  - handles chunked and non-chunked requests
 *  - supports the concurrent chunking feature
 *  - assumes all upload requests are multipart encoded
 *  - supports the delete file feature
 *
 * Follow these steps to get up and running with Fine Uploader in a PHP environment:
 *
 * 1. Setup your client-side code, as documented on http://docs.fineuploader.com.
 *
 * 2. Copy this file and handler.php to your server.
 *
 * 3. Ensure your php.ini file contains appropriate values for
 *    max_input_time, upload_max_filesize and post_max_size.
 *
 * 4. Ensure your "chunks" and "files" folders exist and are writable.
 *    "chunks" is only needed if you have enabled the chunking feature client-side.
 *
 * 5. If you have chunking enabled in Fine Uploader, you MUST set a value for the `chunking.success.endpoint` option.
 *    This will be called by Fine Uploader when all chunks for a file have been successfully uploaded, triggering the
 *    PHP server to combine all parts into one file. This is particularly useful for the concurrent chunking feature,
 *    but is now required in all cases if you are making use of this PHP example.
